# AM32-MultiRotor-ESC-firmware - Crawlers only
original code here https://github.com/AlkaMotors/AM32-MultiRotor-ESC-firmware, 
this firmware is a drastically simplified version of the above linked code, its only meant for crawlers, sine mode, complimentary PWM, and Bi-Directional are always on regardless of config tool settings, lots of tweaks for smoother transistion under heavy load (ex. slow crawling up a steep incline)
