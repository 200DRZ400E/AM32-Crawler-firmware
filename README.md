# AM32-Crawler-ESC-firmware
original code here https://github.com/AlkaMotors/AM32-MultiRotor-ESC-firmware, 
I renamed the repo as I do not want someone to mistakenly load it onto a heli or quad, I changed the firmware with no regards for there types and likely would break something
this firmware is a drastically simplified version of the above linked code, its only meant for crawlers, sine mode, complimentary PWM, and Bi-Directional are always on regardless of config tool settings, lots of tweaks for smoother transistion under heavy load (ex. slow crawling up a steep incline)
